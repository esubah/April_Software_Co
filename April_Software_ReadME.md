## Overview and Origin

April Software is a Luxembourg-based software services provider, specialized in serving investment and wealth management companies.

Our flagship product Data Central is a leading SaaS solution that automatically collects, aggregates, transforms, standardizes, enriches, verifies, and streamlines real-time fund data coming from various third parties into one coherent hub. From there, each user extracts the info he or she needs and prepares, produces, and files reports in seconds

* The company is a privately held company (not listed, incorporated) which was founded in 2005
* The founder of the company is Cedric Nanni, self-identified as a "FundTech Game Changer"
* The company is funded through a subscription model of its flagship SaaS solution, tailored to automate operational issues investment management companies encounter on a daily basis

## Business Activities
1. April Software is in the RegTech domain within the FinTech industry
2. Major trends and innovation in this space and described in the SaaS offering include, but not limited to: Excel add-in to facilitate access to data from multiple providers, Risk Limit Module, Investment Restrictions Module, Fully integrated with Booomberg PORT, scalability regardless of number of users, etc

## Results
1. Through innovation, automation and scalability, the company is able to service both large and small companies, regardless of assets under management, number of employees, etc
2. The company is still a relatively small company relative to its competitors. It is comfortable being small and customizing its products to both small and large companies

## Recommendation
I would like to see Apple expand and compete with other major players in the same space
